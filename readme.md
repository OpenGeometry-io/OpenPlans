OpenPlans can be used in Two Ways

#### 1. A Full Suit Web-App to create Floorplans and 2D Designs of Models
- Provide a Editor Tool which will be used for creation

#### 2. Generate 2D Layouts from an API call/npm package without the need to use WebApp
- To support this, you should provide a list of parameters like Logo, Colors and Model in the API response
- Challenges - How will the model be handled if the file size is large. Think about this.
